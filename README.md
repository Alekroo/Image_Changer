## Project description:
Image Changer is a Python program that lets you change your pictures in a simple and fast way. The program can resize your picture and add
one of two filters, Grayscale or Sepia. The functions have been implemented in different ways by the use of numpy, numba and python to test out 
which one provides the best performance. (This program was created for a university assignment).
